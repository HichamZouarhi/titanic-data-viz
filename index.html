		<h1>Explanatory Analysis of the data of the passengers of the Titanic</h1>

		<div>This document represents a brief analysis of the data of the Titanic, the aim of this analysis is to show how 
		the people act during a catastrophy, the reader can have a different conclusions other than the ones presented in 
		this article, it depends mainly on the relations seen on this data. the data comes from the Kaggle website </div>

		<!-- the divs elements that will hold the charts-->

		<div id="myChart1"></div>

		<div>the first graph above shows that there are more female survivors than male, the difference is clear for the first 
		and second class while it looks like there is an equal number of survivors from both sex from the third class.
		</br>
		Also there seems to be more survivors from the first class than the other classes, we will dive more into this in the 
		next graph</div>

		<div id="myChart2"></div>

		<div>let's see now a graph of the deads by Passenger's class and by Sex, now the difference is clearer, for the first 
		class there seems to be only 3 registered women who died. The same thing goes for the other classes, there seems to be
		more deaths registered for men than women
		</br>
		And there are more deaths in the third class in both classes combined, Apparently the rich people got a premium evacuation, 
		and by considering the position of the first class cabin which was near the life-boats, while the third class dormitories where near the engines rooms
		</div>

		<div id="myChart3"></div>

		<div>Now let's have a look at this from another perspective, let's see which age range was more likely to survive, too bad for the elderly people they were the unlickiest passengers, this is probably because they couldn't support the thermal chock like 
		the younger passengers could
		</br>
		for all the ranges there seem to be more death than survival cases except for the children less than 10years old, they seem to be rescued firsts
		</br>
		</br>
		The series of graphs presented in this document aim to present to the reader my ppoint of view on the normal reaction in case 
		of a catastrophy like the sinking of the Titanic, Save women and children first this is clear from the difference in the Sex and Age of the survivors and deads. While inequality exists even in those times as we see the First class got served first
		</div>
